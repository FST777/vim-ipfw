# vim-ipfw

Syntax-highlighting for IPFW-based rule-files. This was specifically made to highlight rule-files that need to be parsed by a preprocessor, so it might not be foolproof. Pull-requests are welcome.

## Installation

Installation via [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is recommended.
